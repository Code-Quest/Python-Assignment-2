    ''' for each hour, the hour hand travels 30deg
    for each min, the min hand travels 6deg
    to get the angle between the two hands we must take the difference
    of angle of each hand.
    ALSO, in 60 minutes, the hour hand travels 30 deg, so the hour hand is
    moving at a rate of 0.5deg/min
